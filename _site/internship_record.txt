Record of what I did during internship.

Day 1:
Setup environments on catalyst, bp1, bcp4. Briefly looked at some fortran syntax and some 'helloworld' netcdf and hdf5 programs.
Installed these on my own laptop, and started researching how to put them on blue crystal.
Day 2:
Attemptted to put HDF5 and NetCDF on catalyst.
Day 3:
Put Phylo-bayes on bcp3 and setup output for code timeing.
Created Isambard account. Tau profiling doesn't work, check compile log file.
Got phylo-bayes dataset.
Traces=Seeing where different processes diverge, how long they wait, etc
Profile=how long each process spends in certain functions.
Fixed errors in pb_mpi in order to get tau to profile the code
