### Overview
This project involved creating a website for a University of Bristol games project, Khaos Kitchen. The website showcased a range of different technologies, each used with respect to web standards and compatability. A working forum was set up using a NodeJS server and an SQLite3 embedded database. The forum was created dynamically using templating engine 'pug.js', and requested different parts of the forum 'on the fly' as the user needed them.
