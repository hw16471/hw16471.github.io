### Overview
Given my interest in HPC, I have sought to expand my knowledge in the area by taking up an intern position at the Advanced Computing Research Centre (ACRC). At the ACRC, I have spent time analyzing the performance of PhyloBayes - a phylogenetics code - on both Intel and ARM systems. Identifying that PhyloBayes wasn’t vectorizing a key loop, I provided speedups of 2.5x, saving researchers months of computing time. 

### Responsibilities
- Routinely created jobs with slurm and PBS, and experimented with a variety of tools such as TAU, Intel Amplifier and CrayPAT.
- Evaluated the performance of Phylogenetics code, PhyloBayes-MPI, on both Intel and ARM systems. Wrote a comprehensive report on the code’s current performance along with any future improvements.
- Currently optimizing the Met Office’s NAME code (Dispersion Model) to run on ARM systems, to determine whether these achieve similar performance to their Intel counterparts.
- Gained experience in both C++ and Fortran projects.
